# This repository contains my solutions to some Math and Computer Science book exercises and course assignments that I am able to solve.

You are very welcome to criticize my solutions and to point out errors in my solutions. But I'm hoping that you will do it in a polite way.

I don't have teachers or professors to correct my work. Please be my teacher. 

Thanks!
